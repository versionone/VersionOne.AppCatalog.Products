The results can be recorded at two different levels of granularity—project and test. The aggregate results for a suite of tests in FitNesse can be linked to a project in VersionOne, so that everyone can see the health of their project from a testing standpoint from within VersionOne. The results of an individual FitNesse acceptance test can be linked to a Test in VersionOne, so that development team members receive quick feedback on which tests are passing and failing."

It is not recommended that poll intervals remain this low in a production instance. \n * Update: Source code project was dependent on .NET 3.5. Now source code project depends on the latest .NET SDK. \n * Updated: Integration depends on Log4Net \n * Updated: Poll time interval defaults to 30 minutes \n *Fixed: Configuration Utility allows editing of the VersionOne credential fields when Windows Integrated Authentication is enabled. This enables configuring the integrations to connect to VersionOne as a user other than the local service account when the VersionOne instance is configured for Windows integrated authentication.",
