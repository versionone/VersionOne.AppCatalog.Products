        "description": "**This integration was deprecated in the Summer 2015 release of VersionOne.**\n\nThe VersionOne Integration for Fitnesse imports Fitnesse test results into VersionOne, making the latest test results more visible across the an organization. The results can be recorded at two different levels of granularity—project and test. The aggregate results for a suite of tests in Fitnesse can be linked to a project in VersionOne, so that everyone can see the health of their project from a testing standpoint from within VersionOne. The results of an individual Fitnesse acceptance test can be linked to a Test in VersionOne, so that development team members receive quick feedback on which tests are passing and failing."

It is not recommended that poll intervals remain this low in a production instance. \n * Update: Source code project was dependent on .NET 3.5. Now source code project depends on the latest .NET SDK. \n * Updated: Integration depends on Log4Net \n * Updated: Poll time interval defaults to 30 minutes \n *Fixed: Configuration Utility allows editing of the VersionOne credential fields when Windows Integrated Authentication is enabled. This enables configuring the integrations to connect to VersionOne as a user other than the local service account when the VersionOne instance is configured for Windows integrated authentication.",
